This game is based on a fictious game from the Gainax DVD movie, FLCL.

Quote from the actual movie:

	Fire Starter
	No one knows how the city of devils, Endsville, was born.
	As soon as it was created, it prospered,
	And then it slowly ate up the world.
	You serve Cantido, god of the black flame,
	And must hinder its growth by setting it afire.
	Trick the fire fighters, hide from the police,
	And torch the city to purge it of its devils.
	But you mustn't burn everying.
	If the entire city burns down, you will have no place to stay.
	You will not be able to live.
	There can be no final victory.
	The only thing you can do is burn the city.
	Your only hope is to receive the blessing of Cantido, god of black flames.
